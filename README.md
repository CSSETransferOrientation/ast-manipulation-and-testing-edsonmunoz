1. Briefly state how much of the project you completed, e.g. which of the
   sub tasks work.
   I completed half of the project the additive and multiplicative identities now work in the program. the testing also works for both of these identities.
2. Briefly discuss one thing you learned by completing this assignment that
   you believe will be valuable to you in your future courses / programming
   I learned how to work with github to pull and push files. I found that the most useful above everything else. I also got a lot of practice with navigating the terminal.
experiences.
3. Briefly discuss either one aspect of this assignment you did not enjoy or
   one particular difficult bug you encountered.
   I found it really difficult to do this assignment the day it was due. My brain is all gooey after finals and this was a bit of a drag. If you could make it due earlier and assign it earlier I think that would be better. I did not encounter any bugs in the programming really but the tree logic for operators and numbers was a bit tricky to navigate.
